Implementing the simple but effective machine learning model, the perceptron, and applying it to a binary text classification task (i.e., spam detection). 
1. The performance of your standard perceptron and averaged perceptron on the development data.
2. The performance of your standard perceptron and averaged perceptron on the development data with models built from only 10% of the training data.

per_learn.py will learn a perceptron model from labeled data using the standard training algorithm.
avg_per_learn.py will learn a perceptron model from labeled data using the averaged perceptron training algorithm.
per_classify.py will use a stored perceptron model to classify new data.
