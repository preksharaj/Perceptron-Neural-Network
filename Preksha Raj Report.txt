Part III. 

5. How did you calculate precision, recall and F1 score? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it.
I have written a seperate script called calculate.py where we need to specify the output filename of which we need the stats,
as sys.argv[1] while running the script.It will calculate Precision , Recall and F1 score and print it on the terminal.
>>python calculate.py per_output.txt


6. How did you separate 10% of the training data? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it. Explain how you or your code choose the files.
-I just Manually got 10 % of the total training set and used it to train the model and ran the classifier on that model.
